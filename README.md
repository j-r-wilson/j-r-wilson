- 👋 Hi, I’m @j-r-wilson, but call me Josh

- 🈺 Workwise day-to-day currently I am: An app developer alongside doing a masters' degree apprenticeship

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: nothing yet, currently upskilling
- 📫 How to reach me: start a discussion with me on here
- 😄 Pronouns: they/them if required, otherwise none
